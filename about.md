My life with technology started young, 12/13 years old, a Packard Bell 848 Force PC, and the belief that I could make my computer talk to me a la Star Trek.  The "Computer" voice never materialized, but in 1996, when Microsoft Visual Basic 5 hit bookshelves, my enthusiasm to learn how to make those "proggies" (as they were called on AOL back then) overwhelmed my mother's reluctance to spend nearly $200 on a lark and completely changed the course of my life (I had previously been working on following my uncle into cardiology, Doogie Howser was my ficticious hero at the time).

Why VB5?  That was the community I fell in with and I did not have mentors to steer me towards something better like C/C++ or more effective like Pascal (Delphi 6 Personal was still free at this point in history).  I learned how to make chat bots before they were cool, and I still have the numerous 3.5&quot; floppies that were my self-imposed version control (I was 14, I didn't know about CVS, and SVN, git, and mercurial were almost a decade away).  I wrote a dumb RPG demo for a friend, which I am sad to say I probably don't have a functioning copy of anymore.  I did find a poorly functioning copy, but...accidents happen when accessing old floppies.

I moved on to better worlds on the web.  A very good mentor and friend introduced me to Perl and MySQL.  Prior to this, I had this naive expectation that a "database" required a massive amount of hardware to run, more hardware than I could afford working as a programming tutor for my local technology college.  I got good at writing Perl, and I still sometimes miss the terse, cryptic syntax, but Ruby now satisfies that itch well enough.

I intend to use this blog to develop further as a technologist.  My core interests of late have been Civic Tech/Open Data, Discord chat bots, and the like.
